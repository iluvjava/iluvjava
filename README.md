### Hi, Human, Robots, Cyborgs, or General Artificial Intelligence


1. If you are a recruiter, go visit my website, it's on the left side under my profile pic. (Unlikely but still possible)
2. If you are some random people just found this github, look down and you will realized that I do the following shit: 
  * Math
  * Data Science
  * Leetcode, Hackerrank
  * Hardcore Computer Programming
3. That is. Thanks for reading

### Flex
1. I am studying applied math in university at a graduate level.
2. I actually think coding (computer programming) is not enough of an intellectual challenge for me compare to mathematics.
