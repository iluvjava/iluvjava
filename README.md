### Hi, Human, Robots, Cyborgs, or General Artificial Intelligence

1. My personal website is on the left side under my profile pic.
2. If you are random people from the internet who found this github, I do: 
	* Mathematics, specifically mathematical programming and optimizations algorithms. 
	* Leetcode, Hackerrank
	* Hardcore Computer Programming
	* Julia, the pgoramming language
3. I will be looking for jobs at around 2027 with a BS in computational mathematics, a MS in applied Mathematics, and a PhD in pure mathematics. See the about me 2 section below for more. 

### FAQ

Questions: 

1. Where did your math repo went?
2. Why are you privating all your big repos?
3. So, will they come back?
4. Are you still maintainaing your websites? 

Answers: 

1. I have to do that because my math notebooks start to containing somewhat novel and new results.
2. Yes, the julia code is also relevant to some new results.
3. They will come back after the papers are published somehere, I do this to not danger my PhD degree.
4. No. I don't have the time to write LaTEX in HTML for the Katex interpretor and write Javascript and CSS. 

**There may also be a Obsidian notebook in the future where I will host all the maths, like, more than 1200 markdown files.** But before that I need to standardize the some Markdown math formats. 

### About Me, like actually about me and not a flex. 
1. I like psychedelic and ambience music. I like music in general too. 
2. I know Chinese (Native), English with native fluency and mon français est environ CERF niveau B1 maintenant, je suis entrain de apprendre la langue français. 
3. I can write Julia code in a way that it's as fast as C++, FOTRAN, negelecting first compile time, and assume the same algorithm implementations across those langauges. If you want to hire me, for postdoc, or a data intensive things that Julia has an ecosystem (or at least a bit and for open source data format) for it. My skills and qualifications will make you shivers, assuming you actually know what you are talking about.
4. I have an 9 months intern with a startup where I learned the in and outs of rasters files, and the geospatial plugins for PostGres SQL Databases. 
5. I am a 4th year PhD student in pure Mathmatics and please don't say to me you hate math in collage or how math is useless, I heard that everyday from many people. And I don't recommend people to do a PhD in Math, unless they can do 10 hours of math every day and has a brain that is a bit excessive in cognitive function.

So, I can't predict what you are thinking after reading those. I don't really care actually and Eh..., Have a cute pink unicorn pony! >w<

### Sorry, what Mathematics do you learn again? 

Topics in Mathematical Optimizations, covering Nonsmooth Analysis, Convex Analysis, Operator Theories, Duality and Algorithms, and many more. Following prominent researchers: 
	1. [Heinz Bauschke](https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/bauschke/) , 
	2. [Ralph Tyrrell Rockafellar](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Tyrrell_Rockafellar), 
	3. [Amir Beck](https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/becka), 
	4. [Yurri Nesterov](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurii_Nesterov). 

 ### What is your most recent qualification again? 

 I did [University of Washington applied mathematics program](https://amath.washington.edu/master-science-applied-mathematics) for my Master Degree, Professor [Anne Greenbaum](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Greenbaum) was my advisor.
